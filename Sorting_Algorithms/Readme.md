This folder has all the sorting algorithms I implemented along with detailed analysis of their runtimes, how they run on differently sorted arrays, such as almost sorted, unsorted and random arrays. 

I have plotted runtimes and number of swaps or other factors of the algorithms against the array size. 

This helped me gain insights on the performance on these algorithms.
